GMLibrary
=========
This is a library of Java classes that model real world objects.
The project name stands for "Game Model Library" because my initial intention was to
design classes that model objects in a game.
Now, the range of these classes is becoming so vast that I don't know what exactly to call it.
As of 03/14/13, there are 108 classes.
